Just scaffold of a Vision transformer model of Stegnogan. Will be rewriting in Pytorch soon. 
Imported from kaggle for experimenting.
Added the original SGAN model this is based on, along with deployment files and weights.
Scripts for the model, data image loading and augmentation included, along with training loop. 
Utilize the notebook file for the standard gan to experiment
